# Cul_de_sac.py

This code represents a cul-de-sac containing a number of houses, each with its occupants. It defines two classes, cul_de_sac and house, to manage the houses and their occupants. In the main function, the user inputs the number of houses and then specifies two occupants to update their respective houses. The program prints the updated list of houses and occupants after each change. The code provides a simple simulation of people moving between houses in a cul-de-sac.
